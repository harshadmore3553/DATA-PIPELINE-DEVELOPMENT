In this task, I developed a Python-based ETL pipeline that handles raw data and prepares it for analysis or machine learning. The pipeline is capable of Extracting data from a .csv fileTransforming data by:Handling missing valuesScaling numerical columnsEncoding categorical featuresLoading the processed data into a new .csv file The ETL process is fully automated through a Python script that uses Pandas for data manipulation and Scikit-learn pipelines for preprocessing.
Also the tool and technologies used are python ,pandas,Vs code, Scikit learn.
